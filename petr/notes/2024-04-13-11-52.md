## Reflection
This is working better than my previously attempt at the tutorial.
I hope that I can feel satisfied with my learning outcome for this tutorial.
I hope that this is not a new dead end.

Lots of copying again, but I am also creating my own code.
A lot of code is boilerplate I guess.

How else do you learn a language? I am already using the official documentation.
So not some random youtube dude telling me what to do, but the official resources.
