Okay, this is my third try in making this project.
I have learned three ways of starting a project: following tutorial than recreate (bad), 
following tutorial while creating your own stuff (mediocre), using starter project and then expand
on your own (seems the best for now).

I am also still using Vim. Vim is anoying me at the moment to be honest.
It is quite slow, compared to what I am used to.
If I still don't like it after using it a couple of days, I might consider switching back to an IDE.
But why use linux if end up using an ide anyway?
Vim is part of the linux experience.

I spent a lot of time now on making a navbar.
I hope the second item I will make goes faster.
