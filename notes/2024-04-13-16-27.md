I have now succesfully restyled the application provided by the flask team.
It could have been nicer, but I used bootstrap.
I mostly changed templates, next time, I want to actually add features.
I wonder how much changing templates helped me in learning flask.
Maybe I finish this project, and start tomorrow with a new project.
I atleast got somewhat further in learning flask, I think.
Let's see how I can improve next time!
